## Header and Footer
Header and footer are set under the *theme*. Headers and footers are just a widget defined under the theme settings.

## Subheader
You can define a page container as a subheader like this:
![move to header](/assets/layout/move-to-header.png) 


## Custom Layout
Service Portal uses [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/css/) layout by default. In order to add a widget, you must add first a container and then a row and a set of columns. The bootstrap will work for most of the cases but if you needto have a custom layout, for example you want to use flexbox instead of containers you can. Mark the *bootstrap alternative* option.

This option will get rid of the container class. Now you can add a *CSS class* to the container to have a different layout.
